The latter is computed as the log of the count of the given word for that class over the total count of words in that class. If a given word in the vocabulary did not appear when training a specific class, the count for that word in that class will be 0. This results in an estimated likelihood of 0 for that word, which is unreasonable. More importantly howveer, this makes it impossible to find the log likelihood for that word, since the log of 0 is undefined.

This is because in such a case, our dataset is strongly unbalanced towards one class, the positive one. The result is that our model will be incorrectly biased (and in a sense rewarded) for simply learning to predict the majority class regardless of the input. In a way, it is overfitting to a certain class. Because the majority of the input will be of this class, most of the model's predictions will be correct, increasing accuracy and artificially obtaining \"good\" results. While this may be fine for a problem where false positives are not a concern, it becomes problematic in problems sensitive to type I errors.

    "I would expect the number of features to increase squared $O(n + n^2)= O(n^2)$ when using bigrams and cubed $O(n + n^2 + n^3)= O(n^3)$ when using trigrams. In other words, exponentially with the number of items $k$ in largest order n-gram $O(n^k)$ used. This is of course a \"worst-case\" scenario, as this kind of increase would only occur if all possible n-gram combinations were available given our set of unigrams, i.e. if our reviews were very dense. In practice, because of the sparsity of language, the number of features seems to increase linearly instead, as seen by the numbers below (ignoring stemming).\n",
